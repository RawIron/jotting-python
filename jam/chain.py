given a list of pairs
find the longest chain of pairs
a pair can be used exactly once

graph theory:
    a pair models an edge
    find the longest path in the graph
    travel along a given edge exactly once
    pass through a given node once or more than once

example:
[(1,3), (3,4), (5,6)]
[(1,3), (3,4)]

edge cases:
(1,1)
(1,2), (2,1)
(1,2), (2,3), (2,4)
(1,2), (3,2), (2,4)
